# Cleaning-and-Exploring-PPP-Loan-Data-Python
Conducted exploratory analysis and data wrangling on a PPP Loan dataset containing information on over 10 million approved borrowers using Python. Imported data from Excel and .CSV files, performed data cleaning and preparation for analysis. Utilized the pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries for data analysis and visualized results using Tableau.

At one point in time, the Small Business Administration (SBA) had kept their Paycheck Protection Loan data private. But in 2020, a court order changed that. Judge James Boasberg ordered the SBA to release all the information about the loans given to private companies under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This meant that the public would finally get to see the names, addresses, and exact loan amounts of all the PPP and EIDL borrowers.
